# Design
 - Theme
   - The Theme of the website was to build a bright and engaging Quiz website with a blend of both quizzes and fun. 
   - Fonts were imported from google fonts, Boogaloo was used for the logo and nav menu, Libre Franklin for hompage hero text, Montserrat for headings, and Roboto for body text.These were picked as they were crisp and complimented each other and the theme of the site.

 - Color Palette
   - The color palette is made up of four main colors which creates a good contrast and helps support the overall theme.

 ![Color Palette](assets/readme/color-pallet.png)

- Imagery
   - The images that were selected for the website were bold and bright images related to the Quiz Genre.

- Wireframes
   - To create the initial layout and wireframe I used Balsamiq. This helped fine tune the design and layout. It also helped in calculating the amount of content and images required.

  - The site will initially  have a number of quizzes free for everyone. But there will be an option for users to sign up to a monthly subscription service where they get exclusive quizzes every month.

- Other Games

# Testing

### Validator Testing 

 - HTML Validator
   - [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) site was used to validate the **HTML** code.
   - A number of small errors were initially flagged up. Some duplicate tags were removed and I also had to rename a number of images. I also misplaced a link tag in the homepage, as I copied this page structure for the rest of the site i had to fix it on all of these pages also
     - [Erros From Validator Hompage](assets/readme/html-home-error.png)
     - [Erros From Validator Quizzes](assets/readme/error-validator-quizzes.png)
     - [Erros From Validator Triva Quiz](assets/readme/validaor-error-triva-quiz.png)

   

 ### All Pages are now error free see links below:

   - [Quizzes Page](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fwlillisdev.github.io%2Fquiz-master%2Fquizzes.html)
   - [Triva Quizz](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fwlillisdev.github.io%2Fquiz-master%2Fquizz-triva.html) Error because image is hidden until event happens

## CSS Validator
  - The [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the **CSS** code
  - The website passed with no errors

  ![CSS Pass](assets/readme/css-pass-validator.png)

  ### See links below for Results:

   - [CSS Test Results](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwlillisdev.github.io%2Fquiz-master%2Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)

 
## Lighthouse
 - Lighthouse testing was carried out in Developer Tools in Chrome. Initially it gave a number of improvements and flagged up a number of images that needed to be reduced in size. Which was done.

 - The results were also skewed as the chrome extensions on my testing device was affecting the lighthouse results. The tests of all pages were redone in a incognito window and performance score increased.

 ![Hompage](assets/readme/lighthouse-homepage-crop.png)
 - [Quizzes Page lighthouse results](assets/readme/quizzes-pages-lighthouse.png) results are slightly down mainly due to the integration  of google maps api.
 - [Contact Us lighthoust results](assets/readme/contact-lighthouse-crop.png)

 ## Java Script
 - The [JShint](https://jshint.com/) was used to validate the **JavaScrip** code
 - The results initally highlighted a few warnings.
     - [Erros From JShint](assets/readme/jshint-error.png)
     
 - Each item was addressed, The validation loop for the quizz was edited to remove eval. And stack overflow suggested adding / /*jshint esversion: 6 */ to the notes this prevented this error.

 ![JShint Scan Pass](assets/readme/jshint-scan-pass.png)
 
## Manual Testing
  - All the site links were manually tested to see if they all worked ok and linked to the correct locations.
  - The form was checked that name and email were required, that the radio buttons functioned and that the submit button worked.
  - The site was further tested using feedback from mentor,family and friends who checked it on different  devices they had.
  - All of the page's features were tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Opera .
  - Google Chrome's Developer Tool was used to inspect page elements during the build and helped identify  and debug issues within the HTML and CSS.
  - The README.md was checked before final submission and links verified.



# Bugs

  - After running the site through HTML checker, a number of small bugs were identified. Each error was identified and an appropriate solution applied, i went through all pages and fixed any errors. It was good lesson and practice in finding problems with code and fixing them.
  - After Running all the pages through lighthouse, it identified issues with a number of images due to size. Lighthouse suggested to change some larger images which was done.
  - Initially  i had a mouse over event listener  on google maps markers but this was no use for mobile which i realised  when testing, so i changed it to onclick event.
  - I had eval in my validate quiz function, jshint gave this as a warning and a potential security risk so i removed it.
  

  # Unfixed Bugs
  - I am aware there is a console.log Error with Permissions-Policy header: Unrecognized feature: 'interest-cohort'.From what i have researched this is a issue between Github and Google and has no effect on the sites performance.
  - I am aware the website has a lot of large rich images and although images were cropped and compressed it could lead to reduced speed until cached. I have experimented with next gen image formats but currently  they lack browser compatibility  so i just went with png compressed and cropped format for this site.


# Deployment

The site was created using Visual Studio Code and GitHub, and deployed to GitHub pages for testing using the below process:


 - Clicked on my respository for [wlillisdev/quizz-master](https://github.com/wlillisdev/quiz-master).

 - Selected "Main" in branch drop down box.
 - Clicked "save" which produced the live link which can be viewed [here](https://wlillisdev.github.io/quiz-master/).. 

 ## Version Control

   # Conclusion
    - I would like to experiment more with javaScript but as i am only getting to grips with the language i kept concept simple.
    - If I was to build this site again, I would spend more time on the wireframes and know exactly how to structure each section and element before i start.
    - If i had time i would like to add a timer function to the quizz.    
    - I would also learn to make more commits during the project built.
