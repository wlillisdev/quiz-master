# Testing

### Validator Testing 

 - HTML Validator
   - [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) site was used to validate the **HTML** code.
   - A number of small errors were initially flagged up. Some duplicate tags were removed and I also had to rename a number of images. I also misplaced a link tag in the homepage, as I copied this page structure for the rest of the site i had to fix it on all of these pages also
     - [Erros From Validator Hompage](assets/readme/html-home-error.png)
     - [Erros From Validator Quizzes](assets/readme/error-validator-quizzes.png)

 ### All Pages are now error free see links below:

## CSS Validator
  - The [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the **CSS** code
  - The website passed with no errors

  ![CSS Pass](assets/readme/css-pass-validator.png)

  ### See links below for Results:

   - [CSS Test Results](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwlillisdev.github.io%2Fquiz-master%2Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)

 
## Lighthouse
 - Lighthouse testing was carried out in Developer Tools in Chrome. Initially it gave a number of improvements and flagged up a number of images that needed to be reduced in size. Which was done.

 - The results were also skewed as the chrome extensions on my testing device was affecting the lighthouse results. The tests of all pages were redone in a incognito window and performance score increased.

 ![Hompage](assets/readme/lighthouse-homepage-crop.png)
 - [Quizzes Page lighthouse results](assets/readme/quizzes-pages-lighthouse.png) reulsts are slightly down mainly due to the intergation of google maps api.
 - [Contact Us lighthoust results](assets/readme/contact-lighthouse-crop.png)

 ## Java Script
 - The [JShint](https://jshint.com/) was used to validate the **JavaScrip** code
 - The results initally highlighted a few warnings.
     - [Erros From JShint](assets/readme/jshint-error.png)
     
 - Each item was adressed, The validation loop for the quizz was edited to remove eval. And stack overflow suggested adding / /*jshint esversion: 6 */ to the notes this prevented this error.

 ![JShint Scan Pass](assets/readme/jshint-scan-pass.png)
 
## Manual Testing
  - All the site links were manually tested to see if they all worked ok and linked to the correct locations.
  - The form was checked that name and email were required, that the radio buttons functioned and that the submit button worked.
  - The site was further tested using feedback from mentor,family and friends who checked it on diffrent devices they had.
  - All of the page's features were tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Opera .
  - Google Chrome's Developer Tool was used to inspect page elements during the build and helped indentify and debug issues within the HTML and CSS.
  - The README.md was checked before final submission and links verfied.



# Bugs

  - After running the site through HTML checker, a number of small bugs were identified. Each error was identified and an appropriate solution applied, i went through all pages and fixed any errors. It was good lesson and practice in finding problems with code and fixing them.
  - After Running all the pages through lighthouse, it identified issues with a number of images due to size. Lighthouse suggested to change some larger images which was done.
  - Initally i had a mouse over event listiner on google maps markers but this was no use for mobile which i relaised when testing,so i changed it to onclick event.
  - I had eval in my validate quizz function, jshint gave this as a warning and a potential security risk so i removed it.
  

  # Unfixed Bugs
  - I am aware there is a console.log Error with Permissions-Policy header: Unrecognized feature: 'interest-cohort'.From what i have researched this is a issue between Github and Google and has no effect on the sites performance.
  - I am aware the website has a lot of large rich images and although images were cropped and compressed it could lead to reduced speed until cached. I have experimented with next gen image formats but curently they lack browser compatability so i just went with png compressed and cropped format for this site.

   # Conclusion
    - I would like to experiment more with java script but as i am only getting to grips with the language i kept concept simple.
    - If I was to build this site again, I would spend more time on the wireframes and know exactly how to structure each section and element before i start.
    - If i had time i would like to add a timer function to the quizz.    
    - I would also learn to make more commits during the project built.
